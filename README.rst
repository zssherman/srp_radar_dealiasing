Student Research Project Radar Dealiasing
=========================================

Using python and Py-ART to compare hand-dealiased and pyart region-dealiased weather data.

Py-ART Source
-------------
The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, `Py-ART <http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/>`_, is a Python module containing a collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities. Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility for working with data from a number of its precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many types of weather radars.
